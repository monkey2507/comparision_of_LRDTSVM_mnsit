# Comparison of Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and SVM on MNIST Dataset

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files that implement and compare three different machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and SVM) on the MNIST dataset. 
Each notebook focuses on one specific model, providing code, analysis, and visualizations. And i have tried fine tuning the models to reach maximum accuracy. and details are mention in comments of the notebook.
