_# Comparison of Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and SVM on MNIST Dataset_

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files that implement and compare three different machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and SVM) on the MNIST dataset. 
Each notebook focuses on one specific model, providing code, analysis, and visualizations. And i have tried fine tuning the models to reach maximum accuracy. and details are mention in comments of the notebook.
MNSIT dataset is loaded using the keras API. the MNIST dataset is in a format compatible with the Keras 'load_data()' function.
_#usage_
Run Jupyter Notebooks:
Open the desired Jupyter Notebook file (e.g., logistic_regression_mnist.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
Run each cell sequentially to execute the code.
Explore the analysis, visualizations, and model evaluations within each Jupyter Notebook
Feel free to experiment with hyperparameters, explore further improvements, and customize the code to suit your needs.
Each notebook provides an overview of model performance, including evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

_#dataset_
if you run this file with google colab there is no need to download the data set just run all the cells and dataset will be imported through keras.

_#Visualisation_
for every .ipynb file plots such as decision tree and other prediction plots are plotted for easy visualisatiion and understanding
